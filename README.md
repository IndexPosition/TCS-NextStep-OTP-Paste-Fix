# TCS NextStep OTP Paste Fix

 This userscript fixes TCS NextStep's OTP field restrictions that block pasting and force manual typing of OTP, solving the confusion between similar characters (like I/l or O/0).
## Installation

1. **Install a userscript manager**:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

2. **Install the script**:
   - Click [here](https://github.com/IndexPosition/TCS-NextStep-OTP-Paste-Fix/raw/refs/heads/main/pasteFix.user.js) (GitHub raw link)
   - Or copy-paste the code into your userscript manager.

## How It Works
Removes restrictive event handlers and DOM elements that:
- Prevent paste/copy actions
- Display "OTP must be entered manually" warnings
